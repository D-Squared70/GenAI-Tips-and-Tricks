# ü§ñ GenAI Tips and Tricks

Hey there! Welcome to my messy-but-useful collection of GenAI stuff. Think of this as my digital junk drawer, but for AI things I find cool.

## What's This All About?

This repo is pretty simple - it's where I dump all the helpful GenAI things I come across. You'll find system prompts, cool tricks, and random bits of wisdom that I share in my:
- Social media posts
- YouTube videos
- Newsletters
- Random late-night coding sessions

## Fair Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

This place isn't fancy. It's more like that one kitchen drawer where you keep all your useful stuff but never organize it properly. You know the one I'm talking about! 

I try to keep things somewhat tidy, but sometimes life gets busy. So while you might find some amazing AI treasures here, you'll have to do a bit of digging.

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Looking for something specific?** Use GitHub's search feature! It's your best friend here.
2. **Just browsing?** Cool! Click around and see what catches your eye.
3. **Found something useful?** Awesome! That's exactly why this exists.

## What You'll Find Here

- System prompts that actually work
- Weird but helpful AI tricks
- Things that saved my bacon while building with AI
- Random discoveries that made me go "Whoa!"

## Links to My Stuff

When I post something cool about AI on social media or in a video, I'll probably link back to files in this repo. It's like a treasure map, but for AI prompts!

## Updates

I add new stuff whenever I find something worth sharing. No schedule, no promises - just whenever cool things happen!

## Questions?

Got questions? See something weird? Want to chat about AI? Open an issue! I'm always up for a good AI conversation.

Happy exploring! üöÄ
