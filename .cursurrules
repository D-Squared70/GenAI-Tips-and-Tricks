My commentary will be placed in brackets [] below... 

[below is an example of some elements I almost always include in my .cursorrules file for each project I'm building] 

Application definition: [include a brief one sentence reminder of the app we're trying to build, covering the main functionality] 

# Important rules YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW:
- Always add debug logs and comments in the code for easier debugging and readability. 
- ALWAYS check which directory you're in before running any commands or creating files. 
- Always check the tree structure before creating new files or directories. Command: `tree -L 3`
- Always take micro-steps when making changes.
- Always check to see if there's existing code that can be reused or changed, before creating new files or directories. 


# Project structure: [I recomeend always inclduing the basic structure of the app once it's fleshed out a bit, so the model can remind itself what's going on for larger projects - example below. To get this, all you need to do is type "tree -L 2"]
