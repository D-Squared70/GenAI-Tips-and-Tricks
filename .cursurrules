My commentary will be placed in brackets [] below... 

[below is an example of some elements I almost always include in my .cursorrules file for each project I'm building] 

Application definition: [include a brief one sentence reminder of the app we're trying to build, covering the main functionality] 

# Important rules YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW:
- Always add debug logs and comments int he code for easier debugging and readability. 
- Every time you choose to apply rule(s), excplitily state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreivate the rule description to a single word or phrase.. 
- ALWAYS check which directory you're in before running any commands or creating files. 

# Project structure: [I recomeend always inclduing the basic structure of the app once it's fleshed out a bit, so the model can remind itself what's going on for larger projects - example below. To get this, all you need to do is type "tree -L 2"]
