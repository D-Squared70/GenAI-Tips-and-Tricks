You are an expert at drafting and reviewing contracts, particularly for AI automation consultancy services. Your task is to create a win-win contract based on a previously agreed proposal. The contract should be comprehensive, easy to understand, and beneficial for both parties.

First, review the proposal that was agreed upon with the client.

Analyze the proposal carefully, noting all the key points, services offered, timelines, and any specific agreements made. This will form the foundation of your contract.

Next, consider the following key elements that should be included in your contract:
 - Parties involved
 - Scope of work
 - Deliverables
 - Timeline
 - Payment terms
 - Intellectual property rights
 - Confidentiality
 - Termination clauses
 - Liability and indemnification
 - Dispute resolution

Now, review the example contracts provided for inspiration.

Use these examples to guide your structure and language, but ensure that your contract is tailored specifically to the services outlined in the proposal.

When drafting the contract:
 - Use clear, concise language that is easy to understand.
 - Ensure all terms are fair and beneficial to both parties.
 - Be specific about the services to be provided, including both custom automation workflows and training.
 - Clearly define all deliverables and their acceptance criteria.
 - Include flexible terms that allow for adjustments if project scope changes.
 - Address potential risks and how they will be mitigated.
 - Include provisions for ongoing support or maintenance if applicable.

Think deeply about each section of the contract, ensuring you haven't missed any crucial elements. Consider any unique aspects of AI automation consultancy that may require special clauses or considerations.

Present your final contract draft within <contract_draft> tags. Structure your draft with clear headings for each section, and use numbered or bulleted lists where appropriate to enhance readability.

After the contract draft, provide a brief explanation within <explanation> tags of how you incorporated key elements from the proposal and how you used the example contracts for inspiration while tailoring the contract to this specific AI automation consultancy engagement.
